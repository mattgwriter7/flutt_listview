Showing a colleague how to make a listview, and how to have it dynamically add items (on button click)

## Notes    
There are comments in the code where the "magic" happens! ;) 

But the keys are:   
* use ListView.separated() to make separated list items
* it gets populated by the elements in an array of "tile"
* clicking the action button adds another "tile" element
